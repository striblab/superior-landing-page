  <p class="Text_Body">Studies &mdash; and studies of studies &mdash; support what many health care professionals, outdoors people and others believe: Time in nature is good for overall well-being. A random glance at some research: </p>
  <h3>Physical health</h3>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; A health project conducted for National University of Ireland Galway centers on the healing powers of green spaces and even blue (water) spaces. Water heals, researchers said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s visually stimulating, with a thousand shades of constantly moving blue, and wave-exposed coastlines release negative ions believed to alter our biochemistry, lowering our cortisol and lighting up our mood. Dr. Easkey Britton, a scientist and researcher, spoke of making people more &ldquo;ocean-literate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&ldquo;Through this understanding there is empathy and connection, and that&rsquo;s how we overcome the challenges we seems to face,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; A team representing the University of East Anglia in England analyzed data in 143 studies on the relationship of green space and health. The team&rsquo;s report in &ldquo;Environmental Research&rdquo; in July validated the work: Populations exposed to green spaces have reduced risk of type II diabetes, heart disease, stress and other maladies. &ldquo;Although we looked at a large body of research on the relationship &hellip; we don&rsquo;t know exactly what causes this relationship,&rdquo; said the study&rsquo;s author Caoimhe Twohig-Bennett. Still, exposure to the variety of bacteria in natural areas appears to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; The idea of &ldquo;forest bathing&rdquo; is a product of Japan, and has become trendy in the United States in recent years. Called shinrin-yoku in Japanese, forest bathing gets to the therapeutic value of spending long periods of time in the forest. The nature therapy shows it mitigates stress, a pivot point for all sorts of physical ailments from high blood pressure to diabetes. One 2007 study in Japan found that time in nature boosts the immune system, too. A group of men ages 37-55 who walked in the woods showed a significant increase in their natural killer cell activity and the number of those cells, which can kill tumors and virus-infected cells. The results for women were positive, too. A three-day trip to forest areas elevated killer cell activity in a women&rsquo;s group. The positive effect lasted for more than seven days, similar to the findings among the men.</p>
  <h3>Mental health</h3>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; Profiled in the bestselling book &ldquo;The Nature Fix,&rdquo; researcher David Strayer of the University of Utah found that a group of Outward Bound participants performed 50 percent better on creative problem-solving tasks after three days of wilderness backpacking.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; A study involving Stanford and Michigan universities in 2013 found a walk in a nature setting of people suffering from major depression lifted their mood and improved their memory. A conclusion was that incorporating nearby nature into cities may counteract some of the adverse effects of the urban environment.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; Published in &ldquo;Psychological Science&rdquo; in 2013, a Stanford University study dug into the experience of &ldquo;awe,&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;an overwhelming feeling or reverence, admiration, fear or wonder produced by that which is grand and sublime.&rdquo; Researchers concluded that awe expands people&rsquo;s perception of time, bolster feelings of well-being and causes people to behave more altruistically and to be less attached to material things.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">&bull; A 2009 study from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, showed that children with attention deficit disorder concentrated better after a walk in the park than after a downtown walk or a stroll in a neighborhood. Such doses of nature, the study concluded, might serve as a safe, inexpensive tool in managing the brain disorder.</p>
