  <h4>Melanie&rsquo;s hiking tips</h4>
  <p>After hiking 5,500 miles over the last several years, Melanie Radzicki McManus has learned a thing or two. Here are some of her best practices:</p>

    <h4>Create a flexible plan</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Plan where you&rsquo;ll start and stop hiking each day, but also target an earlier campsite or trailhead in case the going gets tough. When it comes to challenging paths, you may not get as far as you normally do. Also wise: Start out with low-mile days, then build up from there.</p>

    <h4>Use trekking poles</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Trekking poles are multipurpose tools every hiker should have. They take pressure off of your knees, legs, ankles and feet, and allow you to move more quickly and easily, especially when heading uphill or downhill. They can also be used for balance, to gauge how deep a water crossing is and to push aside thorny vegetation. And using them on a warm day ensures your hands and fingers won&rsquo;t swell, as they keep them parallel to the ground, not pointed down.</p>

    <h4>Bring zip-top bags</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Use them to securely hold items such as used hand wipes and food wrappers, or your cell phone if it begins to rain.</p>

    <h4>Consider compression sleeves</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Compression garments can be worn on your calves and arms. Calf sleeves protect your lower legs from the majority of scruffy vegetation while being cooler than pants. Arm sleeves are great for days when the temperature varies. Pull them up when chilly and roll them down when it&rsquo;s warm. Try them out before hitting the trail.</p>

    <h4>Carry lubricant</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Whether you prefer petroleum jelly or a commercial product such as Body Glide, slather it on anywhere you develop hot spots. Keep it handy after it rains or you complete a water crossing, as wet shorts can lead to serious chafing. Also good to have: lip balm.</p>

    <h4>Don&rsquo;t forget carabiners</h4>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Carabiners are great at securing items to your pack such as car keys, water bottles and sandals. At night, use them to create a laundry line.</p>
